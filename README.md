  ```    
The best way to install OpenCV is from source since there are multiple ways
to compile it (using GPU optimizations for instance). In order to automate this
process I've put together scripts that install the necessary prerequisites
and build OpenCV with C++, Java and Python bindings. I also included example
source, so you can test the installation. Some of the examples will show you
optimization techniques using motion detection and ROI.

I no longer build ffmpeg from source. Instead I rely on libav, so the install
process is faster now. Both Python and Java work with VideoWriter using X264
as well.

### Platforms Supported
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x86 (32 bit)
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x86_64 (64 bit)
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ARMV7 (32 bit)
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ARMV8 (64 bit)

### OpenCV versions
I have included branches aligned with various versions of OpenCV. I'm not keeping
the branches up to date, but you can see where they were at the time of branching.
If you wish to use a branch then you will need to bring some things up to date
yourself. The master branch is aligned to OpenCV master. For some reason OpenCV
uses branches sometimes and tags others, but not consistently. For instance, there
is a 2.4 branch, but no 3.1 branch. Tags seem to be the preferred method of
organizing releases.

If something breaks when executing code with the OpenCV master branch then try
again another day. I have had times where something that worked would segfault
the JVM which was happening down in the C++ code. All part of being on the
cutting edge. I have also moved to Ubuntu 16.04 in the master branch.

### WARNING
This script has the ability to install/remove Ubuntu packages and it also
installs some libraries from source. This could potentially screw up your system
(if it's not a fresh install), so use with caution! I suggest using a VM for
testing before using it on your physical systems. I tried to make the defaults
sane in config-*.sh files.

### To do
* Install X265 - I tried FFMPEG PPA and libx265-dev, but no luck with X265 FOURCC.

### Provides
* OpenCV from source
    * opencv_contrib is built by default, but can be disabled in config-opencv.sh.
    * ARM optimizations
    * Patch libjpeg to mute common warnings that will fill up the logs
* Java 8 and Apache Ant
    * Patch memory leaks as I find them. Get more information [here](https://github.com/sgjava/opencvmem)
    * FourCC class
    * CaptureUI Applet to view images/video since there's no imshow with the bindings
* Java, Python and C++ examples can be easily run from Eclipse.
    * Capture UI
    * Motion detection
    * People detection
    * Camera Calibration
    * Drawing
* Scripts update individual components without having to worry about uninstalling them first
    * Java
    * OpenCV 

### Build

Make sure the following is in your /etc/apt/sources.list for ARM:
```
deb http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ xenial multiverse
deb-src http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ xenial multiverse
deb http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ xenial-updates multiverse
deb-src http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports/ xenial-updates multiverse
```
* On ARM platforms with limited memory create a swap file or the build may fail
with an out of memory exception. To create a 1GB swap file use:
    * `sudo su -`
    * `dd if=/dev/zero of=tmpswap bs=1024 count=1M`
    * `mkswap tmpswap`
    * `swapon tmpswap`
    * `free`
* `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sgjava/install-opencv.git`
* `cd install-opencv/scripts/ubuntu`
* Edit config-*.sh files and change versions or switches as needed
* Run individual scripts to update individual components
    * `sudo ./install-java.sh` to install/update Java
    * `sudo ./install-opencv.sh` to install/update OpenCV
* Run script in foreground or background to install all components
    * `sudo ./install.sh` to run script in foreground
    * `sudo sh -c 'nohup ./install.sh &'` to run script in background

#### Build output
* Check install logs for any problems with the installation scripts.
* OpenCV home `/home/<username>/opencv-3.1.x`
* Java and Python bindings `/home/<username>/opencv-3.1.x/build`
* OpenCV contrib `/home/<username>/opencv-3.1.x`

### Java
To run Java programs in Eclipse you need add the OpenCV library.
* Window, Preferences, Java, Build Path, User Libraries, New..., OpenCV, OK
* Add External JARs..., /home/&lt;username&gt;/opencv-3.1.x/build/bin/opencv-31x.jar
* Native library location, Edit..., External Folder..., /home/&lt;username&gt;/opencv-3.1.x/build/lib, OK
* Right click project, Properties, Java Build Path, Libraries, Add Library..., User Library, OpenCV, Finish, OK
* Import [Eclipse project](https://github.com/sgjava/install-opencv/tree/master/opencv-java)

To run compiled class (Canny for this example) from shell:
* `cd /home/<username>/workspace/install-opencv/opencv-java`
* `java -Djava.library.path=/home/<username>/opencv-3.1.x/build/lib -cp /home/<username>/opencv-3.1.x/build/bin/opencv-31x.jar:bin com.codeferm.opencv.Canny`

#### Things to be aware of
* There are no bindings generated for OpenCV's GPU module.
* Missing VideoWriter generated via patch (if needed).
* Missing constants generated via patch.
* There's no imshow equivalent, so check out [CaptureUI](https://github.com/sgjava/install-opencv/blob/master/opencv-java/src/com/codeferm/opencv/CaptureUI.java)
* Understand how memory management [works](https://github.com/sgjava/opencvmem)
* Make sure you call Mat.free() to free native memory
* The JNI code can modify variables with the final modifier. You need to be aware of the implications of this since it is not normal Java behavior.

![CaptureUI Java](images/captureui-java.png)
   
The Canny example is slightly faster in Java (3.08 seconds) compared to Python
(3.18 seconds). In general, there's not enough difference in processing over 900
frames to pick one set of bindings over another for performance reasons.

### C++
To create a new C++ project in Eclipse you need to install CDT plugin first (or use the Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers). I'm using the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, so I installed the CDT plugin.
* Help, Install New Software..., Add..., Name: CDT, Location: http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/8.8.1 (this is for Eclipse Mars), OK, select CDT Main Features and CDT Optional Features, Next, Next, I accept the terms of the license agreement, Finish, Yes

To run C++ example projects
* Import [Eclipse projects](https://github.com/sgjava/install-opencv/tree/master/opencv-cpp) one at a time

![CaptureUI C++](images/captureui-cpp.png)

To create new C++ project
* Change to C/C++ perspcetive, File, New, C++ Project, Project name: test, Hello World C++ Project, Cross GCC, Next, Next, Next, Finish
* Open terminal (Crtl+Alt+T) and run `pkg-config --cflags opencv` and note output for next step
* Right click project, Properties, C/C++ Build, Settings, Cross GCC Compiler, Includes, Include paths(-l), click +, Directory: /usr/local/include/opencv, OK'
* Open terminal (Crtl+Alt+T) and run `pkg-config --libs opencv` and note output for next step
* Right click project, Properties, C/C++ Build, Settings, Cross G++ Linker, Libraries, Library search path (-L), click +, Directory: /usr/local/lib, OK
* Right click project, Properties, C/C++ Build, Settings, Cross G++ Linker, Libraries, Libraries(-l), click +, Libraries(-l): opencv_core, repeat for other libraries such as opencv_imgproc opencv_highgui, OK
* Open test.cpp and replace all the text with:
```
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

using namespace cv;

int main() {
	// Create black empty image
	Mat image = Mat::zeros(240, 320, CV_8UC3);
	// Draw circles

		circle(image, Point(160, 120), 10.0 * a, Scalar(128, 128, 255), 2, 8);
	}
	// Draw lines
	for (int a = 0; a < 15; a = a + 1) {
		line(image, Point(2 + a * a, 40), Point(318, 40 + a * a), Scalar(0, 255, 0),
				2, 8);
